            Hello, I'm Angel Ortega, a passionate cross-platform software developer. 
            When I'm not exploring new galaxies of knowledge and skills in the software development 
            universe, you can find me in two of my favorite hobbies:

                I'm a big fan of open world games like Assassin's Creed and 
                Far Cry, where I can explore vast landscapes and embark on 
                exciting adventures. Not only are video games a fun way to relax,
                but I also appreciate the complexity and creativity that goes into
                developing these immersive worlds.

                I love the process of assembling desktop computers, especially for gamers. From choosing components to final assembly,
                each step is like a puzzle that needs to be solved. And the satisfaction of seeing the machine working perfectly after all
                the hard work is simply indescribable.
